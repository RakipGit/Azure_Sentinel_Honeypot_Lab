#🛡️ Azure Sentinel Honeypot Lab (SIEM Detection Project)

This project demonstrates a self-built cloud honeypot using a publicly exposed Azure VM and Microsoft Sentinel to detect brute-force login attempts from real-world threat actors.

-------

##💡 Project Summary

I built a cloud-based detection lab on Azure to simulate unauthorized access attempts and observe brute-force activity. Logs were ingested into Microsoft Sentinel for monitoring, detection, and manual incident investigation.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Created an Azure **Resource Group**, **VNet**, and **Windows 10 VM**
- Configured **NSG** to allow all inbound traffic and disabled **Windows Firewall**
- Simulated failed RDP logins.Verified **Event ID 4625** in Event Viewer
- Connected the VM to a **Log Analytics Workspace**
- Installed and configured **Microsoft Sentinel**
- Used **KQL** to identify failed login attempts from attacker IPs
- Imported a **GeoIP watchlist** to enrich attacker data
- Created a **Sentinel Workbook** to visualize global attack locations
- Built a custom **Analytics Rule** to detect brute-force login patterns
- Investigated Sentinel-generated incidents via the **Investigation Graph**
- Validated attacker IPs using **VirusTotal** and manually closed **True Positive** incidents
