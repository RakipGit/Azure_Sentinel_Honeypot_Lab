## 🛡️ Azure Sentinel Honeypot Lab (SIEM Detection Project)

This project demonstrates a self-built cloud honeypot using a publicly exposed Azure VM and Microsoft Sentinel to detect brute-force login attempts from real-world threat actors.

---

## 💡 Project Summary

I built a cloud-based detection lab on Azure to simulate unauthorized access attempts and observe brute-force activity. Logs were ingested into Microsoft Sentinel for monitoring, detection, and manual incident investigation.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Created an Azure **Resource Group**, **VNet**, and **Windows 10 VM**
- Configured **NSG** to allow all inbound traffic and disabled **Windows Firewall**
- Simulated failed RDP logins.Verified **Event ID 4625** in Event Viewer
- Connected the VM to a **Log Analytics Workspace**
- Installed and configured **Microsoft Sentinel**
- Used **KQL** to identify failed login attempts from attacker IPs
- Imported a **GeoIP watchlist** to enrich attacker data
- Created a **Sentinel Workbook** to visualize global attack locations
- Built a custom **Analytics Rule** to detect brute-force login patterns
- Investigated Sentinel-generated incidents via the **Investigation Graph**
- Validated attacker IPs using **VirusTotal** and manually closed **True Positive** incidents
- Blocked the confirmed malicious IP** using an **NSG deny rule** and verified it with **IP Flow Verify** in **Network Watcher**

## 🧠 Insights & Lessons Learned

- Exposing the VM to the internet allowed me to simulate real-world attacks and observe how attackers behave in a short timeframe.
- Disabling the VM firewall and creating open NSG rules were intentional misconfigurations to attract brute-force attempts, which were successfully logged and analyzed.
- I used Microsoft Sentinel’s built-in analytics rules to detect and alert on suspicious activity, following the full incident lifecycle: detection, investigation, validation, and closure.
- Validating attacker IPs using **VirusTotal** added strong confidence in marking incidents as true positives.
- I manually blocked the confirmed malicious IP using a **Network Security Group (NSG) deny rule**, and verified it was working using **Azure Network Watcher - IP Flow Verify**.
- This project helped me gain hands-on experience with how cloud SIEM systems like Microsoft Sentinel operate — from monitoring and detection to response and hardening the environment post-incident.
